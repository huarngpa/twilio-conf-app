# Twilio Conferencing Application

## Overview

This application is just some toy code pulled together one evening (and day) to explore how the Twilio services work. Suffice to say, the documentation and resources available out in the web are amazing!!

Besides just exploring some base Twilio services, I thought I might be able to write a proof-of-concept for conference messaging service. Do you remember a time when Skype or meet-me lines were contained in the body of calendar invites and users had to fish conference lines and passcodes out to dial in?

Well, this application is a throwback to days when this was a real pain in the butt for users. Using the form, you can input a phone number to send conferencing information to!

This example can be easily extended to do things like notify users when a web transaction completes (ie. payments) or whatever else.
